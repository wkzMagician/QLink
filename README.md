# QLink
QLink is a simple link game based on Qt.
However, it is in RPG mode, which means you have to control a player who can move around, hit the boxes, linking and eliminating them.
QLink itself is a project assigned by SJTU, SE  
The requirement is in "大作业1-QLink.pdf"  
Besides the basic functions, I also add a music player to the game, which makes it more playable.  

# Warning
You can learn from my code, but attention: the Duplicate Check is very strict. Even you modify the names of majority identifiers, teachers would find out that you cheat.
