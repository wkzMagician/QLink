# QLink
A simple game of eliminating boxes by linking in a RPG mode, using qt  
It is a project assigned by SJTU, SE  
The requirement is in "大作业1-QLink.pdf"  
Besides the basic functions, I also add a music player to the game, which makes it more playable.  

# Warning
You can learn from my code, but attention: the Duplicate Check is very strict. Even you modify the names of majority identifiers, teachers would find out that you cheat.
